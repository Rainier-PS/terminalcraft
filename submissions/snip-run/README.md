# snip-run

**snip-run** is a way to neatly organize your small programs and random code snippets
the dir structure nudges you to tidy all the related files up, rather than letting them plague your ~

## features

* pretty interface (thanks to `prompt_toolkit`)
* quickly add common "modifiers" like a file for stderr or timing the snippet
* automatically select a file for things like logs
